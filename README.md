Pokémon Battle Arena

Current Version: Release Candidate v1.3

Many of us have grown up with GameBoys. They were our pride and pastime. The GameBoy was home to some of the biggest games in history: Super Mario Bros., The Legend of Zelda Series, Tetris and Kirby, just to name a few. However, there was one game that captivated our interest more than any other. A certain RPG, developed by GameFreak, inc., along with Creatures, inc. and Nintendo. A game designed by a small team of enthusiasts, including now-legends such as Satoshi Tajiri, Ken Sugimori and Shigeru Miyamoto over a term of a long six years. A little duo of games, known as Pocket Monsters Red and Pocket Monsters Green, known better by their international names, Pokémon Red and Pokémon Blue.

Racking up amazing achievements, such as the title of one of the bestselling GameBoy games ever and an impressive (and extremely rare) IGN score of 10.0, these games went on to become what we see around us everywhere. Anime, TCG, TFG, Manga, and over 20 more main series games and countless spin-offs soon followed. Today, there is even a company just for Pokémon, that's just how big it has become.

This project aims to recreate these games in C++. Not just the creatures, but the exact mechanics and gameplay of the games
